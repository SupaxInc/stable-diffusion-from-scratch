# Creating a Stable Diffusion Model from Scratch
Learning how to create stable diffusion from the ground up beginning with Variational Autoencoders, CLIP, Denoising UNet, DDPM scheduler, etc. The inspiration here was so I could
understand what is happening under the hood when I implement it myself for future projects.

I'd like to thank Umar Jamil youtube channel for the amazing break-downs and guides on Transformers and Diffusion models. A lot of the content here was inspired from his videos and all I've done
was just simplify it further so I can understand it better in my own words along with diving deeper with my own research. Check him out at [Umar Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/@umarjamilai).
